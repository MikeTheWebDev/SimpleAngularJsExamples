<b>Getting Started</b><br>
This repository shows simple AngularJS examples. These are intended to be quick-start pieces to set you on the right path. Please look at the Simple Snippets folder. This is the most useful part of this repository. 

I recommend starting off with "AngularJS Fundamentals in 60-ish Minutes" by Dan Wahlin linked down below in the resources section.

Ater messing around for an hour or two you can go here to setup your environment with yeoman scaffolding which will give you a working environment to dive deeper! http://www.sitepoint.com/kickstart-your-angularjs-development-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/
