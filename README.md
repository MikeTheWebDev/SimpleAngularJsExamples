# SimpleAngularJsExamples
This repository shows simple AngularJS examples. These are intended to be quick-start pieces to set you on the right path. 

I recommend starting off by first messing with some tutorials online, and using an online editor. This allows you to avoid a typical roadblock of having your browser block local data. Then when you have a decent foundation after messing around for an hour or two you can go here to setup your environment with yeoman. http://www.sitepoint.com/kickstart-your-angularjs-development-with-yeoman-grunt-and-bower/
